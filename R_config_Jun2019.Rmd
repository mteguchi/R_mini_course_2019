\section{A little trick for the future ease of package management
(Windows)}\label{a-little-trick-for-the-future-ease-of-package-management-windows}

If you are using Mac, I don't know how this would affect. You need to
look around on the Internet when you have problems finding libraries.

We'll use many different packages and they need to be updated
frequently. When R comes out with a major update, libraries need to be
found by R. They don't seem to have an automatic way of keeping track of
libraries. I have been lazy not to add ``path'' information to the R
startup. Now, I'm teaching how to use R, I thought it would be best to
pass on this information so that you won't have to deal with the
headache in the future. You may need your Administrator access.

Open ``Control Panel''

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/Control_Panel1_a.png')
```


Select ``User Accounts''

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/User_Accounts_a.png')
```

Select ``Change my environment variables'' on the left-hand panel:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/Enviro_Vars_a.png')
```

Click on "New..." on the top half, then type in "R\_LIBS\_USER"
(without quotation marks) for "Variable name" and "%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\R"
for "Variable value" and click "OK":

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/Enviro_Vars2_a.png')
```

Then, create the folder (R) by going to the path, in my case
"C:\\Users\\tomo\.eguchi\\AppData\\Local" and create a new folder and name it "R".

You may not see this folder because it's hidden under the default setup of Windows. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/NoAppData.png')
```

To make it visible, you have to go change the setting. Go to the Control Panel and select "Appearance and Personalization"

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/Control_Panel3.png')
```

Then, select "Show hidden files and folders" under "Folder Options"

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/FolderOptions1.png')
```

Then, select "Show hidden files and folders". 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/ShowHiddenFiles.png')
```

Then, you should be able to see it:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/AppData.png')
```

Now create the folder (R) by going to the path, in my case
"C:\\Users\\tomo\.eguchi\\AppData\\Local" and create a new folder and name it "R".

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/New_Folder_a.png')
```

You see an "R" folder already in the picture because I already had it.
